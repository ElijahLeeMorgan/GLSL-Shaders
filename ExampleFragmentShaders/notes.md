*NOTES*
Shaders, and graphics in general, are "dumb" by the design of the hardware. Each pixel is ignorant of eachother and cannot store memory.
Polygons and circles are much easier than rectanges.
Fragment vs Vector shaders.
    Vector shaders occour between forming polygons/triangles in a scene and projecting them onto the camera.
    Fragment shaders occour during rasterization, which means they effect the pixels directly.
